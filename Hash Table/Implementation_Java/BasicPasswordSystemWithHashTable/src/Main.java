        Hash table is basically data structure that holds the variables with the key, value relation.
        HashTable(Key,Value)

        Hashing is the mapping technique to disguise real data. Hashing algorithm takes given
        argument and gives back encrypted data

        To my knowledge, it's better practice to keep password values as hashed in database. That's why
        I thought to code this practise project to recap hash table.
