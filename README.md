# SoftwareEngineering--DataStructures
- This project has been creted while practising the data structures.
  
- Main folder has DataStructures.pdf that explains what data structure and its types.

- Every folder of the data structure (such as tree, array, linkedlist...) cointains 2 folders which are documentation and Implementation_Java folders.
  
- Documentation folders contain pdf that I created by taking notes while studying that data structure. In short pdf explains the data structure.

- Some of the documentation folders also have images and some other supportive documentation.

- Implementation_Java folder contains implementation of that data structure in Java. Also some of them have data structure's predefined methods in Java.

- In implementations, my main purpose was to practise and understand the data structure, I was not concerned about best practise design patterns, efficiency and complexity matters.



## Technologies
- Implementations are done in Java while practising.
